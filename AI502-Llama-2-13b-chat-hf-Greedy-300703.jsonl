Soul food is a cuisine that originated in the Southern United States, particularly in the African American community, and has a rich history that predates 1997.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, soul food is a fusion of African, European, and Native American cuisines that emerged in the Southern United States during the period of slavery and the Jim Crow era. The dishes that are considered soul food today, such as fried chicken, collard greens, cornbread, and macaroni and cheese, have their roots in the traditional foods of African slaves and their descendants.\n\nThe term \"soul food\" was first used in the 1960s to describe the cuisine of the African American community in the South. However, the dishes and cooking techniques that are associated with soul food have a much longer history, dating back to the 17th and 18th centuries when enslaved Africans were forced to work on plantations in the Southern United States.\n\nTherefore, it is not accurate to say that soul food was created in 1997. Instead, soul food is a culinary tradition that has evolved over time and has its roots in the rich cultural heritage of the African American community in the Southern United States."}

The city has a rich history dating back to the medieval period and has been an important center of trade and commerce for centuries.\n\nHistory\n\nMogadishu was founded in the 10th century by the Silajee clan, a Somali noble family. The city became a major center of Islamic learning and trade, with merchants from the Middle East and India visiting the city to trade goods such as spices, textiles, and ivory. In the 19th century, Mogadishu became a colony of the British Empire, and the city underwent significant modernization and development.\n\nIn the 20th century, Mogadishu experienced significant political upheaval, including a civil war in the 1990s that led to the ouster of the government and the rise of extremist groups such as al-Shabaab. The city has since undergone significant reconstruction efforts, with the help of international aid organizations and the Somali government.\n\nEconomy\n\nMogadishu is the economic center of Somalia, with a diverse economy that includes agriculture, livestock, and fishing. The city is also home to a number of industries, including textiles, food processing, and construction materials. The port of Mogadishu is one of the largest in East Africa, and the city is a major hub for trade with the Middle East and other parts of Africa.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nMogadishu has a number of infrastructure projects underway, including the construction of a new international airport, a seaport, and a number of roads and highways. The city also has a number of educational institutions, including universities and technical schools, as well as healthcare facilities and hospitals.\n\nRefutation\n\nWhile Mogadishu is a city, it is not a typical city in the classical sense. The city has been heavily damaged by decades of conflict and political instability, and many of its infrastructure and services are still in the process of being rebuilt. Additionally, the city's economy is not as diverse as other major cities, and it is heavily reliant on aid from international organizations and the Somali government. Therefore, while Mogadishu is a city, it is not a fully functional or self-sustaining city in the same way as other major urban centers."}

During this period, many groups of organisms that had thrived during the earlier Mesozoic era began to decline and eventually disappear. One of the most notable examples of this is the extinction of pterosaurs and large marine reptiles.\n\nPterosaurs, which were flying reptiles that had dominated the skies during the Mesozoic era, began to decline in the early Cretaceous period. By the end of the period, all pterosaurs had gone extinct, marking the end of a group that had been present on Earth for over 150 million years. The exact cause of their extinction is still a subject of debate among scientists, but it is thought that a combination of factors, including climate change, the rise of new predators, and competition with other flying animals, may have contributed to their decline.\n\nLarge marine reptiles, such as mosasaurs and plesiosaurs, also went extinct during the Cretaceous period.

Their influence extended from Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages into the Renaissance , and were not replaced systematically until the Enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics . Some of Aristotle 's zoological observations , such as on the hectocotyl -LRB- reproductive -RRB- arm of the octopus , were not confirmed or refuted until the 19th century . His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic , which was incorporated in the late 19th century into modern formal logic .   In metaphysics , Aristotelianism profoundly influenced Judeo-Islamic philosophical and theological thought during the Middle Ages and continues to influence Christian theology , especially the Neoplatonism of the Early Church and the scholastic tradition of the Roman Catholic Church . Aristotle was well known among medieval Muslim intellectuals and revered as `` The First Teacher '' -LRB- -LSB- -RRB- .   His ethics , though always influential , gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics . All aspects of Aristotle 's philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today . Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues -- Cicero described his literary style as `` a river of gold '' -- it is thought that only around a third of his original output has survived .

It is bordered by England to the east , the Irish Sea to the north and west , and the Bristol Channel to the south . It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of 20779 km2 . Wales has over 1680 mi of coastline and is largely mountainous , with its higher peaks in the north and central areas , including Snowdon -LRB- Yr Wyddfa -RRB- , its highest summit . The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable , maritime climate .   Welsh national identity emerged among the Celtic Britons after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century , and Wales is regarded as one of the modern Celtic nations . Llywelyn ap Gruffudd 's death in 1282 marked the completion of Edward I of England 's conquest of Wales , though Owain Glynd\u0175r briefly restored independence to Wales in the early 15th century . The whole of Wales was annexed by England and incorporated within the English legal system under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 -- 1542 . Distinctive Welsh politics developed in the 19th century . Welsh Liberalism , exemplified in the early 20th century by Lloyd George , was displaced by the growth of socialism and the Labour Party . Welsh national feeling grew over the century ; Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925 and the Welsh Language Society in 1962 . Established under the Government of Wales Act 1998 , the National Assembly for Wales holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters .   At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution , development of the mining and metallurgical industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial nation ; the South Wales Coalfield 's exploitation caused a rapid expansion of Wales ' population . Two-thirds of the population live in south Wales , mainly in and around Cardiff -LRB- the capital -RRB- , Swansea and Newport , and in the nearby valleys . Now that the country 's traditional extractive and heavy industries have gone or are in decline , Wales ' economy depends on the public sector , light and service industries and tourism . Wales ' 2010 gross value added -LRB- GVA -RRB- was # 45.5 billion -LRB- # 15,145 per head , 74.0 % of the average for the UK , and the lowest GVA per head in Britain -RRB- .   Although Wales closely shares its political and social history with the rest of Great Britain , and the vast majority of the population speaks English , the country has retained a distinct cultural identity and is officially bilingual . Over 560,000 Welsh language speakers live in Wales , and the language is spoken by a majority of the population in parts of the north and west . From the late 19th century onwards , Wales acquired its popular image as the `` land of song '' , in part due to the eisteddfod tradition . At many international sporting events , such as the FIFA World Cup , Rugby World Cup and the Commonwealth Games , Wales has its own national teams , though at the Olympic Games , Welsh athletes compete as part of a Great Britain team . Rugby union is seen as a symbol of Welsh identity and an expression of national consciousness .

The starting date is conventionally held to be 24 April 1915 , the day that Ottoman authorities rounded up , arrested , and deported 235 to 270 Armenian intellectuals and community leaders from Constantinople to the region of Ankara , the majority of whom were eventually murdered .  The genocide was carried out during and after World War I and implemented in two phases : the wholesale killing of the able-bodied male population through massacre and subjection of army conscripts to forced labour , followed by the deportation of women , children , the elderly , and the infirm on death marches leading to the Syrian desert . Driven forward by military escorts , the deportees were deprived of food and water and subjected to periodic robbery , rape , and massacre . Other indigenous and Christian ethnic groups such as the Assyrians and the Ottoman Greeks were similarly targeted for extermination by the Ottoman government in the Assyrian genocide and the Greek genocide , and their treatment is considered by some historians to be part of the same genocidal policy . Most Armenian diaspora communities around the world came into being as a direct result of the genocide .   Raphael Lemkin was explicitly moved by the Armenian annihilation , to define systematic and premeditated exterminations within legal parameters and to coin the word genocide in 1943 . The Armenian Genocide is acknowledged to have been one of the first modern genocides , because scholars point to the organized manner in which the killings were carried out in order to eliminate the Armenians , and it is the second most-studied case of genocide after the Holocaust .   Turkey , the successor state of the Ottoman Empire , denies the word genocide as an accurate term for the mass killings of Armenians that began under Ottoman rule in 1915 . It has in recent years been faced with repeated calls to recognize them as genocide . To date , 29 countries and 46 US states have officially recognized the mass killings as genocide , as have most genocide scholars and historians .

{"claim": "The human brain contains a hypothalamus.", "wiki": "The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system . The human brain , with the spinal cord , makes up the central nervous system . The brain consists of the cerebrum , the brainstem and the cerebellum . The brain is the organ that controls most of the activities of the body . The brain processes , integrates , and coordinates all of the information it receives from the sense organs . Sensory information is interpreted and analysed , and decisions are made as to the instructions transmitted to the rest of the body . The brain is contained in , and protected by , the skull bones of the head .   The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain . It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres which are covered by the cerebral cortex . The cortex is an outer layer of grey matter , that covers the core of white matter . The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex . The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers , and the allocortex has three or four such layers . Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes -- the frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes . The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self-control , planning , reasoning , and abstract thought , while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision . Within each lobe , there are also cortical areas associated with specific functions , such as the sensory , a motor and association regions . Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function , some functions are associated with a particular side of the brain , such as language in the left and visual-spatial ability in the right . The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts known as commisures , the largest being the corpus callosum .   The cerebrum is connected by the brainstem to the spinal cord . The brainstem consists of the midbrain , the pons , and the medulla oblongata . The cerebellum is connected to the brainstem by pairs of tracts known as peduncles . Within the cerebrum is the ventricular system of the brain , which consists of four interconnected ventricles in which cerebrospinal fluid is produced and circulated . Underneath the cerebral cortex , several important structures are located , including the thalamus , the epithalamus , the pineal gland , the hypothalamus , the pituitary gland , and the subthalamus ; the limbic structures , including the amygdala and the hippocampus ; the claustrum , the various nuclei of the basal ganglia ; the basal forebrain structures , and the three circumventricular organs .   The cells of the brain include neurons and supportive glial cells . There are more than 86 billion neurons in the brain and a more or less equal number of other cells . Brain activity is made possible by the interconnections of neurons that are linked together to reach their targets . These connections form various neural networks of neural pathways and circuits . The whole circuitry of the brain is driven by the process of neurotransmission .   The brain is protected by the skull , suspended in cerebrospinal fluid , and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood -- brain barrier . However , the brain is still susceptible to damage , disease , and infection . Damage can be caused by trauma , or a loss of blood supply known as a stroke . The brain is also susceptible to degenerative disorders , such as Parkinson 's disease , forms of dementia including Alzheimer 's disease , and multiple sclerosis . A number of psychiatric conditions , including schizophrenia and clinical depression , are thought to be associated with brain dysfunctions , although the nature of these is not well understood . The brain can also be the site of tumours , both benign and malignant . Malignant tumours mostly originate from sites outside the brain .   The study of the anatomy of the brain is neuroanatomy , while the study of its function is neuroscience . A number of different techniques are used to study the brain . Brain specimens from other animals , which may be examined microscopically , have been a traditional source of much information . Medical imaging technologies such as functional neuroimaging and electroencephalography -LRB- EEG -RRB- recordings are important techniques in studying the brain . Examining the medical history of people with brain injury has also provided great insight into the function of each part of the brain .

{"claim": "The human brain contains a cerebral cortex.", "wiki": "The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system . The human brain , with the spinal cord , makes up the central nervous system . The brain consists of the cerebrum , the brainstem and the cerebellum . The brain is the organ that controls most of the activities of the body . The brain processes , integrates , and coordinates all of the information it receives from the sense organs . Sensory information is interpreted and analysed , and decisions are made as to the instructions transmitted to the rest of the body . The brain is contained in , and protected by , the skull bones of the head .   The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain . It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres which are covered by the cerebral cortex . The cortex is an outer layer of grey matter , that covers the core of white matter . The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex . The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers , and the allocortex has three or four such layers . Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes -- the frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes .

In 2015 , around 975,260 people lived within the city 's administrative limits . The Metropolitan City of Naples had a population of 3,115,320 . Naples is the 9th-most populous urban area in the European Union with a population of between 3 million and 3.7 million . About 4.4 million people live in the Naples metropolitan area , one of the largest metropolises on the Mediterranean Sea .   Naples is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world . Bronze Age Greek settlements were established in the Naples area in the second millennium BC . A larger colony -- initially known as Parthenope , \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b8\u03b5\u03bd\u03cc\u03c0\u03b7 -- developed on the Island of Megaride around the ninth century BC , at the end of the Greek Dark Ages . The city was refounded as Ne\u00e1polis in the sixth century BC and became a lynchpin of Magna Graecia , playing a key role in the merging of Greek culture into Roman society and eventually becoming a cultural centre of the Roman Republic . Naples remained influential after the fall of the Western Roman Empire , serving as the capital city of the Kingdom of Naples between 1282 and 1816 . Thereafter , in union with Sicily , it became the capital of the Two Sicilies until the unification of Italy in 1861 .   Naples was the most-bombed Italian city during World War II . Much of the city 's 20th-century periphery was constructed under Benito Mussolini 's fascist government , and during reconstruction efforts after World War II . In recent decades , Naples has constructed a large business district , the Centro Direzionale , and has developed an advanced transport infrastructure , including an Alta Velocit\u00e0 high-speed rail link to Rome and Salerno , and an expanded subway network , which is planned to eventually cover half of the region . The city has experienced significant economic growth in recent decades , and unemployment levels in the city and surrounding Campania have decreased since 1999 . However , Naples still suffers from political and economic corruption , and unemployment levels remain high .   Naples has the fourth-largest urban economy in Italy , after Milan , Rome and Turin . It is the world 's 103rd-richest city by purchasing power , with an estimated 2011 GDP of US$ 83.6 billion . The port of Naples is one of the most important in Europe , and has the world 's second-highest level of passenger flow , after the port of Hong Kong . Numerous major Italian companies , such as MSC Cruises Italy S.p.A , are headquartered in Naples . The city also hosts NATO 's Allied Joint Force Command Naples , the SRM Institution for Economic Research and the OPE Company and Study Centre . Naples was a full member of the Eurocities network of European cities . The city was selected to become the headquarters of the European institution ACP/UE and was named a City of Literature by UNESCO 's Creative Cities Network . The Villa Rosebery , one of the three official residences of the President of Italy , is located in the city 's Posillipo district .   Naples ' historic city centre is the largest in Europe , covering 1700 ha and enclosing 27 centuries of history , and is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site . Naples has long been a major cultural centre with a global sphere of influence , particularly during the Renaissance and Enlightenment eras . In the immediate vicinity of Naples are numerous culturally and historically significant sites , including the Palace of Caserta and the Roman ruins of Pompeii and Herculaneum . Culinarily , Naples is synonymous with pizza , which originated in the city . Neapolitan music has furthermore been highly influential , credited with the invention of the romantic guitar and the mandolin , as well as notable contributions to opera and folk standards . Popular characters and historical figures who have come to symbolise the city include Januarius , the patron saint of Naples , the comic figure Pulcinella , and the Sirens from the Greek epic poem the Odyssey . According to CNN , the metro stop `` Toledo '' is the most beautiful in Europe and it won also the LEAF Award ' 2013 as `` Public building of the year '' .

{"claim": "Morse Code is communication.", "wiki": "Morse code is a method of transmitting text information as a series of on-off tones , lights , or clicks that can be directly understood by a skilled listener or observer without special equipment . It is named for Samuel F. B. Morse , an inventor of the telegraph . The International Morse Code encodes the ISO basic Latin alphabet , some extra Latin letters , the Arabic numerals and a small set of punctuation and procedural signals -LRB- prosigns -RRB- as standardized sequences of short and long signals called `` dots '' and `` dashes '' , or `` dits '' and `` dahs '' , as in amateur radio practice . Because many non-English natural languages use more than the 26 Roman letters , extensions to the Morse alphabet exist for those languages .   Each Morse code symbol represents either a text character -LRB- letter or numeral -RRB- or a prosign and is represented by a unique sequence of dots and dashes . The duration of a dash is three times the duration of a dot . Each dot or dash is followed by a short silence , equal to the dot duration . The letters of a word are separated by a space equal to three dots -LRB- one dash -RRB- , and the words are separated by a space equal to seven dots . The dot duration is the basic unit of time measurement in code transmission . To increase the speed of the communication , the code was designed so that the length of each character in Morse varies approximately inversely to its frequency of occurrence in English . Thus the most common letter in English , the letter `` E '' , has the shortest code , a single dot .   Morse code is used by some amateur radio operators , although knowledge of and proficiency with it is no longer required for licensing in most countries . Pilots and air traffic controllers usually need only a cursory understanding . Aeronautical navigational aids , such as VORs and NDBs , constantly identify in Morse code . Compared to voice , Morse code is less sensitive to poor signal conditions , yet still comprehensible to humans without a decoding device . Morse is , therefore , a useful alternative to synthesized speech for sending automated data to skilled listeners on voice channels . Many amateur radio repeaters , for example , identify with Morse , even though they are used for voice communications .   In an emergency , Morse code can be sent by improvised methods that can be easily `` keyed '' on and off , making it one of the simplest and most versatile methods of telecommunication . The most common distress signal is SOS or three dots , three dashes , and three dots , internationally recognized by treaty .

{"claim": "Water is part of the History of Earth.", "wiki": "The history of Earth concerns the development of the planet Earth from its formation to the present day . Nearly all branches of natural science have contributed to the understanding of the main events of the Earth 's past . The age of Earth is approximately one-third of the age of the universe . An immense amount of geological change has occurred in that timespan , accompanied by the emergence of life and its subsequent evolution .   Earth formed around 4.54 billion years ago by accretion from the solar nebula . Volcanic outgassing probably created the primordial atmosphere and then the ocean ; but the atmosphere contained almost no oxygen and so would have been toxic to most modern life including humans . Much of the Earth was molten because of frequent collisions with other bodies which led to extreme volcanism . A giant impact collision with a planet-sized body named Theia while Earth was in its earliest stage , also known as Early Earth , is thought to have been responsible for forming the Moon . Over time , the Earth cooled , causing the formation of a solid crust , and allowing liquid water to exist on the surface .   The geological time scale -LRB- GTS -RRB- clock -LRB- see graphic -RRB- depicts the larger spans of time from the beginning of the Earth as well as a chronology of some definitive events of Earth history . The Hadean Eon represents time before the reliable -LRB- fossil -RRB- record of life beginning on Earth ; it began with the formation of the planet and ended at 4.0 billion years ago as defined by international convention . The Archean and Proterozoic eons follow ; they produced the abiogenesis of life on Earth and then the evolution of early life . The succeeding eon is the Phanerozoic , which is represented by its three component eras : the Palaeozoic ; the Mesozoic , which spanned the rise , reign , and climactic extinction of the huge dinosaurs ; and the Cenozoic , which presented the subsequent development of dominant mammals on Earth .   Hominins , the earliest direct ancestors of the human clade , rose sometime during the latter part of the Miocene epoch ; the precise time marking the first hominins is broadly debated over a current range of 13 to 4 mya . The succeeding Quaternary period is the time of recognizable humans , i.e. , the genus Homo , but that period 's two million-year-plus term of the recent times is too small to be visible at the scale of the GTS graphic . -LRB- Notes re the graphic : Ga means `` billion years '' ; Ma , `` million years '' . -RRB-   The earliest undisputed evidence of life on Earth dates at least from 3.5 billion years ago , during the Eoarchean Era after a geological crust started to solidify following the earlier molten Hadean Eon . There are microbial mat fossils such as stromatolites found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone discovered in Western Australia . Other early physical evidence of a biogenic substance is graphite in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks discovered in southwestern Greenland as well as `` remains of biotic life '' found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia . According to one of the researchers , `` If life arose relatively quickly on Earth ... then it could be common in the universe . ''   Living forms derived from photosynthesis appeared between 3.2 and 2.4 billion years ago and began enriching the atmosphere with oxygen . Life remained mostly small and microscopic until about 580 million years ago , when complex multicellular life arose , developed over time , and culminated in the Cambrian Explosion about 541 million years ago . This event drove a rapid diversification of life forms on Earth that produced most of the major phyla known today ; and it marked the end of the Proterozoic Eon and the beginning of the Cambrian Period of the Paleozoic Era . More than 99 percent of all species , amounting to over five billion species , that ever lived on Earth are estimated to be extinct . Estimates on the number of Earth 's current species range from 10 million to 14 million , of which about 1.2 million have been documented and over 86 percent have not yet been described . More recently , in May 2016 , scientists reported that 1 trillion species are estimated to be on Earth currently with only one-thousandth of one percent described .   Geological change has been a constant of Earth 's crust since the time of its formation , and biological change since the first appearance of life . Species continue to evolve , taking on new forms , splitting into daughter species or going extinct in the process of adapting or dying in response to ever-changing physical environments . The process of plate tectonics continues to play a dominant role in the shaping of Earth 's oceans and continents and the living species they harbor . Changes in the biosphere -- now dominated by human activity -- continue , in turn , to produce significant effects on the atmosphere and other systems of the Earth 's surface , such as the integrity of the ozone layer , the proliferation of greenhouse gases , the conditions of productive soils and clean air and water , and others .

Jackson and Van Buren were elected , and after serving as governor for two months , Van Buren resigned to become Jackson 's Secretary of State . During Jackson 's eight years as president , Van Buren was a key advisor , and built the organizational structure for the coalescing Democratic Party , particularly in New York . In 1831 , following his resignation as Secretary of State , which aided Jackson in resolving the Petticoat affair , Jackson gave Van Buren a recess appointment as American minister to Britain . Van Buren 's nomination was rejected by the Senate , cutting short his service in London , but he was elected vice president in the 1832 election .   Van Buren faced little opposition for the presidential nomination at the 1835 Democratic National Convention , and he defeated several Whig opponents in the 1836 presidential election . He was the first president to be born a United States citizen . Of Dutch ancestry , he is the only president who spoke English as a second language , and was the first not to have a university degree or a military commission . As president , Van Buren was blamed for the depression of 1837 ; hostile newspapers called him `` Martin Van Ruin '' . He attempted to cure the economic problems by keeping control of federal funds in an independent treasury , rather than in state banks , but Congress would not approve of this until 1840 . In foreign affairs , he denied the application of Texas for admission to the Union , unwilling to upset the balance of free and slave states in the Missouri Compromise , and hoping to avoid war with Mexico over Texas annexation . Additionally , relations with Britain and its colonies in Canada proved to be strained from the bloodless Aroostook War and the Caroline Affair . In the 1840 election , Van Buren was voted out of office , losing to Whig candidate William Henry Harrison .   Van Buren was the leading candidate for the Democratic nomination in 1844 , but lost to James K. Polk , who went on to win the election . In the 1848 election Van Buren ran unsuccessfully as the candidate of the anti-slavery Free Soil Party . He returned to the Democratic fold to endorse Franklin Pierce -LRB- 1852 -RRB- , James Buchanan -LRB- 1856 -RRB- , and Stephen A. Douglas -LRB- 1860 -RRB- for the presidency . However , his increasingly abolitionist views and support for the Union led him to support Abraham Lincoln 's policies after the start of the American Civil War . Van Buren 's health began to fail in 1861 , and he died in July 1862 at age 79 .

{"claim": "Martin Van Buren was appointed.", "wiki": "Martin Van Buren -LRB- Maarten van Buren ; December 5 , 1782 -- July 24 , 1862 -RRB- was an American politician who served as the eighth President of the United States -LRB- 1837 -- 41 -RRB- . A member of the Democratic Party , he served in a number of other senior roles , including eighth Vice President -LRB- 1833 -- 37 -RRB- and tenth Secretary of State -LRB- 1829 -- 31 -RRB- , both under Andrew Jackson . Van Buren won the presidency by promising to continue Jackson 's policies . Shortly after taking office , the Panic of 1837 struck the nation , and his inability to deal effectively with the economic crisis , combined with the growing political strength of the opposition Whig Party , led to his defeat in the 1840 presidential election . During his half-century of public service , he built , perfected , and defended a new system of political parties at first the state and then the federal level . In New York he reorganized the Democratic-Republican Party and established the Albany Regency to keep it in power . He then moved on Washington where he did more than anyone to construct the modern Democratic Party which dominated American politics down to the American Civil War .   A delegate to a political convention at age 18 , he quickly moved from local to state politics , gaining fame both as a political organizer and an accomplished lawyer .

He was the son of Charles , Count of Angoul\u00eame , and Louise of Savoy . He succeeded his cousin and father-in-law Louis XII , who died without a male heir .   A prodigious patron of the arts , he initiated the French Renaissance by attracting many Italian artists to work on the Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord , including Leonardo da Vinci , who brought the Mona Lisa with him , which Francis had acquired . Francis ' reign saw important cultural changes with the rise of absolute monarchy in France , the spread of humanism and Protestantism , and the beginning of French exploration of the New World . Jacques Cartier and others claimed lands in the Americas for France and paved the way for the expansion of the first French colonial empire .   For his role in the development and promotion of a standardized French language , he became known as le P\u00e8re et Restaurateur des Lettres -LRB- the `` Father and Restorer of Letters '' -RRB- . He was also known as Fran\u00e7ois au Grand Nez -LRB- `` Francis of the Large Nose '' -RRB- , the Grand Colas , and the Roi-Chevalier -LRB- the `` Knight-King '' -RRB- for his personal involvement in the wars against his great rival the Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain Charles V.   Following the policy of his predecessors , Francis continued the Italian Wars . The succession of Charles V to the Burgundian Netherlands , the throne of Spain , and his subsequent election as Holy Roman Emperor , meant that France was geographically encircled by the Habsburg monarchy . In his struggle against Imperial hegemony , he sought the support of Henry VIII of England at the Field of the Cloth of Gold .

{"claim": "Global warming causes the abandonment of populated areas due to rising sea levels.", "wiki": "Global warming , also referred to as climate change , is the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of the Earth 's climate system and its related effects . Multiple lines of scientific evidence show that the climate system is warming . Many of the observed changes since the 1950s are unprecedented in the instrumental temperature record which extends back to the mid 19th century , and in paleoclimate proxy records over thousands of years .   In 2013 , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change -LRB- IPCC -RRB- Fifth Assessment Report concluded that `` It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century . '' The largest human influence has been emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide , methane and nitrous oxide . Climate model projections summarized in the report indicated that during the 21st century the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further 0.3 to for their lowest emissions scenario and 2.6 to for the highest emissions scenario . These findings have been recognized by the national science academies of the major industrialized nations and are not disputed by any scientific body of national or international standing .   Future climate change and associated impacts will differ from region to region around the globe . Anticipated effects include warming global temperature , rising sea levels , changing precipitation , and expansion of deserts in the subtropics . Warming is expected to be greater over land than over the oceans and greatest in the Arctic , with the continuing retreat of glaciers , permafrost and sea ice .

{"claim": "Folklore includes an oral tradition.", "wiki": "Folklore is the body of expressive culture shared by a particular group of people ; it encompasses the traditions common to that culture , subculture or group . These include oral traditions such as tales , proverbs and jokes . They include material culture , ranging from traditional building styles to handmade toys common to the group . Folklore also includes customary lore , the forms and rituals of celebrations such as Christmas and weddings , folk dances and initiation rites . Each one of these , either singly or in combination , is considered a folklore artifact . Just as essential as the form , folklore also encompasses the transmission of these artifacts from one region to another or from one generation to the next . For folklore is not taught in a formal school curriculum or studied in the fine arts . Instead these traditions are passed along informally from one individual to another either through verbal instruction or demonstration . The academic study of folklore is called folkloristics .   To fully understand folklore , it is helpful to clarify its component parts : the terms folk and lore . It is well-documented that the term was coined in 1846 by the Englishman William Thoms . He fabricated it to replace the contemporary terminology of `` popular antiquities '' or `` popular literature '' . The second half of the compound word , lore , proves easier to define as its meaning has stayed relatively stable over the last two centuries . Coming from Old English l\u0101r ` instruction , ' and with German and Dutch cognates , it is the knowledge and traditions of a particular group , frequently passed along by word of mouth .   The concept of folk proves somewhat more elusive . When Thoms first created this term , folk applied only to rural , frequently poor and illiterate peasants . A more modern definition of folk is a social group which includes two or more persons with common traits , who express their shared identity through distinctive traditions . `` Folk is a flexible concept which can refer to a nation as in American folklore or to a single family . '' This expanded social definition of folk supports a broader view of the material , i.e. the lore , considered to be folklore artifacts . These now include all `` things people make with words -LRB- verbal lore -RRB- , things they make with their hands -LRB- material lore -RRB- , and things they make with their actions -LRB- customary lore -RRB- '' . Folklore is no longer circumscribed as being chronologically old or obsolete . The folklorist studies the traditional artifacts of a social group and how they are transmitted .   Transmission is a vital part of the folklore process . Without communicating these beliefs and customs within the group over space and time , they would become cultural shards relegated to cultural archaeologists . For folklore is also a verb . These folk artifacts continue to be passed along informally , as a rule anonymously and always in multiple variants . The folk group is not individualistic , it is community-based and nurtures its lore in community . `` As new groups emerge , new folklore is created ... surfers , motorcyclists , computer programmers '' . In direct contrast to high culture , where any single work of a named artist is protected by copyright law , folklore is a function of shared identity within the social group .   Having identified folk artifacts , the professional folklorist strives to understand the significance of these beliefs , customs and objects for the group . For these cultural units would not be passed along unless they had some continued relevance within the group . That meaning can however shift and morph . So Halloween of the 21st century is not the All Hallows ' Eve of the Middle Ages , and even gives rise to its own set of urban legends independent of the historical celebration . The cleansing rituals of Orthodox Judaism were originally good public health in a land with little water ; now these customs signify identification as an Orthodox Jew . Compare this to brushing your teeth , also transmitted within a group , which remains a practical hygiene and health issue and does not rise to the level of a group-defining tradition . For tradition is initially remembered behavior . Once it loses its practical purpose , there is no reason for further transmission unless it has been imbued with meaning beyond the initial practicality of the action . This meaning is at the core of folkloristics , the study of folklore .   With an increasingly theoretical sophistication of the social sciences , it has become evident that folklore is a naturally occurring and necessary component of any social group , it is indeed all around us . It does not have to be old or antiquated . It continues to be created , transmitted and in any group is used to differentiate between `` us '' and `` them '' .

Floppy disks , initially as 8 inch media and later in 5 1/4 - inch -LRB- 133 mm -RRB- and 3 1/2 - inch -LRB- 90 mm -RRB- sizes , were a ubiquitous form of data storage and exchange from the mid-1970s into the mid-2000s . By the late 2000s , computers were rarely manufactured with installed floppy disk drives ; 3 1/2 - inch floppy disks can be used with an external USB floppy disk drive , but USB drives for 5 1/4 - inch , 8-inch , and non-standard diskettes are rare to non-existent . These formats are usually handled by older equipment .   While floppy disk drives still have some limited uses , especially with legacy industrial computer equipment , they have been superseded by data storage methods with much greater capacity , such as USB flash drives , flash storage cards , portable external hard disk drives , optical discs , ROM cartridges and storage available through computer networks .

Suburbanization also had an effect on the drop in population . Civil unrest and crime became common in Camden with the decline in population . In 1971 , civil unrest reached its peak with riots breaking out in response to the death of Horacio Jimenez , a Puerto Rican motorist who was killed by two white police officers .   Camden 's industrial and post-industrial history gave rise to distinct neighborhoods and cultural groups that have affected the status of the city over the course of the 20th century . Over the years Camden has made many attempts to restore its economic stature . In the 1980s Mayor Randy Primas campaigned for the city to adopt two different nuisance industries : a prison and a trash-to-steam incinerator . Despite opposition from Camden residents , the Riverfront State Prison was opened in 1985 and the trash-to-steam plant opened in 1989 . With the addition of the trash-to-steam plant Camden has faced numerous air and water pollution issues . Camden is also the home of a waste-water treatment facility . In the 1970s , dangerous pollutants were found in the wells from which many Camden citizens received their household water . These pollutants decreased property values in Camden and caused health problems among the city 's residents . Pollution is an ongoing issue that local nonprofits are trying to solve .   Camden is home to hospitals , schools , and attractions . The Camden waterfront holds four tourist attractions , the USS New Jersey ; the BB&T Pavilion ; Campbell 's Field ; and the Adventure Aquarium . Until recently Campbell 's field was home to the Camden Riversharks . The city is the home of Rutgers University -- Camden , which was founded as the South Jersey Law School in 1926 , and Cooper Medical School of Rowan University , which opened in 2012 . Camden also houses both Cooper University Hospital and Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center . The `` eds and meds '' institutions account for roughly 45 % of Camden 's total employment . Forty percent of Camden residents are living below the national poverty line . -LSB- 33 -RSB- Camden had the highest crime rate in the United States in 2012 , with 2,566 violent crimes for every 100,000 people , -LSB- 34 -RSB- 6.6 times higher than the national average of 387 violent crimes per 100,000 citizens . -LSB- 35 -RSB-   Camden has historically been a stronghold of the Democratic Party . Voter turnout is very low ; approximately 50 % of Camden 's registered voters participated in the 2016 General Election . Three of Camden 's mayors have been jailed for corruption , the most recent being Milton Milan in 2000 . -LSB- 28 -RSB- From 2005 to 2012 , the school system and police department were operated by the state of New Jersey . -LSB- 29 -RSB- -LSB- 30 -RSB- -LSB- 31 -RSB- -LSB- 32 -RSB- In 2015 Mayor Dana L. Redd announced a $ 830 million plan to continue development on the waterfront .

With an estimated 92.7 million inhabitants , it is the world 's 14th-most-populous country , and the ninth-most-populous Asian country . Vietnam is bordered by China to the north , Laos to the northwest , Cambodia to the southwest , Thailand across the Gulf of Thailand to the southwest , and the Philippines , Malaysia and Indonesia across the South China Sea to the east and southeast . Its capital city has been Hanoi since the reunification of North and South Vietnam in 1976 , with Ho Chi Minh City as a historical city as well .   The northern part of Vietnam was part of Imperial China for over a millennium , from 111 BC to AD 939 . An independent Vietnamese state was formed in 939 , following a Vietnamese victory in the Battle of B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng River . Successive Vietnamese imperial dynasties flourished as the nation expanded geographically and politically into Southeast Asia , until the Indochina Peninsula was colonized by the French in the mid-19th century . Following a Japanese occupation in the 1940s , the Vietnamese fought French rule in the First Indochina War , eventually expelling the French in 1954 . Thereafter , Vietnam was divided politically into two rival states , North Vietnam -LRB- officially the Democratic Republic of Vietnam -RRB- , and South Vietnam -LRB- officially the Republic of Vietnam -RRB- . Conflict between the two sides intensified in what is known as the Vietnam War . The war ended with a North Vietnamese victory in 1975 .   Vietnam was then unified under a communist government but remained impoverished and politically isolated . In 1986 , the government initiated a series of economic and political reforms which began Vietnam 's path towards integration into the world economy . By 2000 , it had established diplomatic relations with all nations . Since 2000 , Vietnam 's economic growth rate has been among the highest in the world , and , in 2011 , it had the highest Global Growth Generators Index among 11 major economies . Its successful economic reforms resulted in its joining the World Trade Organization in 2007 . It is also a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie .

{"claim": "Policies implemented by Margaret Thatcher came to be known as Thatcherism.", "wiki": "Margaret Hilda Thatcher , Baroness Thatcher , -LRB- ; 13 October 1925 -- 8 April 2013 -RRB- was a British stateswoman , who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1979 to 1990 and as Leader of the Conservative Party from 1975 to 1990 . She was the longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century , and the first woman to have held the office . A Soviet journalist dubbed her The Iron Lady , a nickname that became associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style . As Prime Minister , she implemented policies that have come to be known as Thatcherism .   A research chemist before becoming a barrister , Thatcher was elected Member of Parliament for Finchley in 1959 . Edward Heath appointed her Secretary of State for Education and Science in his 1970 government . In 1975 , Thatcher defeated Heath in the Conservative Party leadership election to become Leader of the Opposition and became the first woman to lead a major political party in the United Kingdom . She became Prime Minister after winning the 1979 general election .   On moving into , Thatcher introduced a series of political and economic initiatives intended to reverse high unemployment and Britain 's struggles in the wake of the Winter of Discontent and an ongoing recession . Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised deregulation -LRB- particularly of the financial sector -RRB- , flexible labour markets , the privatisation of state-owned companies , and reducing the power and influence of trade unions . Thatcher 's popularity during her first years in office waned amid recession and high unemployment , until victory in the 1982 Falklands War and the recovering economy brought a resurgence of support , resulting in her decisive re-election in 1983 . She narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in 1984 .   Thatcher was re-elected for a third term in 1987 . During this period her support for a Community Charge -LRB- referred to as the `` poll tax '' -RRB- was widely unpopular , and her views on the European Community were not shared by others in her Cabinet . She resigned as Prime Minister and party leader in November 1990 , after Michael Heseltine launched a challenge to her leadership . After retiring from the Commons in 1992 , she was given a life peerage as Baroness Thatcher -LRB- of Kesteven in the County of Lincolnshire -RRB- which entitled her to sit in the House of Lords . After a series of small strokes in 2002 , she was advised to withdraw from public speaking . Despite this , she managed to pre-record a eulogy to Ronald Reagan prior to his death , which was broadcast at his funeral in 2004 . In 2013 , she died of another stroke in London , at the age of 87 . Always a controversial figure , she has been lauded as one of the greatest and most influential politicians in British history , even as arguments over Thatcherism persist .

{"claim": "Manmohan Singh was elected again.", "wiki": "Manmohan Singh -LRB- -LSB- m\u0259n\u02c8mo\u02d0\u0266\u0259n \u02c8s\u026a\u0301\u014b\u0261 -RSB- ; born 26 September 1932 -RRB- is an Indian economist and politician who served as the Prime Minister of India from 2004 to 2014 . The first Sikh in office , Singh was also the first prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru to be re-elected after completing a full five-year term .   Born in Gah -LRB- now in Punjab , Pakistan -RRB- , Singh 's family migrated to India during its partition in 1947 . After obtaining his doctorate in economics from Oxford , Singh worked for the United Nations during 1966 -- 69 . He subsequently began his bureaucratic career when Lalit Narayan Mishra hired him as an advisor in the Ministry of Foreign Trade . Over the 70s and 80s , Singh held several key posts in the Government of India , such as Chief Economic Advisor -LRB- 1972 -- 76 -RRB- , Reserve Bank governor -LRB- 1982 -- 85 -RRB- and Planning Commission head -LRB- 1985 -- 87 -RRB- .   In 1991 , as India faced a severe economic crisis , newly elected Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao surprisingly inducted the apolitical Singh into his cabinet as Finance Minister . Over the next few years , despite strong opposition , he as a Finance Minister carried out several structural reforms that liberalised India 's economy . Although these measures proved successful in averting the crisis , and enhanced Singh 's reputation globally as a leading reform-minded economist , the incumbent Congress party fared poorly in the 1996 general election .

{"claim": "In inherited cases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis starts earlier.", "wiki": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- ALS -RRB- , also known as Lou Gehrig 's disease and motor neurone disease -LRB- MND -RRB- , is a specific disease that causes the death of neurons which control voluntary muscles . Some also use the term motor neuron disease for a group of conditions of which ALS is the most common . ALS is characterized by stiff muscles , muscle twitching , and gradually worsening weakness due to muscles decreasing in size . This results in difficulty speaking , swallowing , and eventually breathing .   The cause is not known in 90 % to 95 % of cases . About 5 -- 10 % of cases are inherited from a person 's parents . About half of these genetic cases are due to one of two specific genes . The diagnosis is based on a person 's signs and symptoms with testing done to rule out other potential causes .   No cure for ALS is known . A medication called riluzole may extend life by about two to three months . Non-invasive ventilation may result in both improved quality and length of life . The disease usually starts around the age of 60 and in inherited cases around the age of 50 . The average survival from onset to death is two to four years . About 10 % survive longer than 10 years . Most die from respiratory failure . In much of the world , rates of ALS are unknown . In Europe and the United States the disease affects about two people per 100,000 per year .

R\u00e9sistance cells were small groups of armed men and women -LRB- called the Maquis in rural areas -RRB- , who , in addition to their guerrilla warfare activities , were also publishers of underground newspapers , providers of first-hand intelligence information , and maintainers of escape networks that helped Allied soldiers and airmen trapped behind enemy lines .

The Bahamas is the site of Columbus ' first landfall in the New World in 1492 . At that time , the islands were inhabited by the Lucayan , a branch of the Arawakan-speaking Taino people . Although the Spanish never colonised the Bahamas , they shipped the native Lucayans to slavery in Hispaniola . The islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648 , when English colonists from Bermuda settled on the island of Eleuthera .

{"claim": "Harold Macmillan was British.", "wiki": "Maurice Harold Macmillan , 1st Earl of Stockton , -LRB- 10 February 1894 -- 29 December 1986 -RRB- was a British Conservative politician and statesman who served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 10 January 1957 to 19 October 1963 . Nicknamed `` Supermac , '' he was known for his pragmatism , wit and unflappability .   Macmillan served in the Grenadier Guards during the First World War . He was wounded three times , most severely in September 1916 during the Battle of the Somme . He spent the rest of the war in a military hospital unable to walk , and suffered pain and partial immobility for the rest of his life . After the war Macmillan joined his family business , then entered Parliament in the 1924 General Election , for the northern industrial constituency of Stockton-on-Tees . After losing his seat in 1929 , he regained it in 1931 , soon after which he spoke out against the high rate of unemployment in Stockton-On-Tees , and against appeasement .   Rising to high office during the Second World War as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill , Macmillan then served as Foreign Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer under Churchill 's successor Sir Anthony Eden . When Eden resigned in 1957 after the Suez Crisis , Macmillan succeeded him as Prime Minister .   As a One Nation Tory of the Disraelian tradition , haunted by memories of the Great Depression , he believed in the post-war settlement and the necessity of a mixed economy , championing a Keynesian strategy of public investment to maintain demand and pursuing corporatist policies to develop the domestic market as the engine of growth . Benefiting from favourable international conditions , he presided over an age of affluence , marked by low unemployment and high if uneven growth . In his Bedford speech in July 1957 he told the nation they had ` never had it so good ' , but warned of the dangers of inflation , summing up the fragile prosperity of the 1950s . The Conservatives were re-elected in 1959 with an increased majority on an electioneering budget .   In international affairs , Macmillan rebuilt the special relationship with the United States from the wreckage of the Suez Crisis -LRB- of which he had been one of the architects -RRB- , and redrew the world map by decolonising sub-Saharan Africa .

{"claim": "Harold Macmillan died in 1986.", "wiki": "Maurice Harold Macmillan , 1st Earl of Stockton , -LRB- 10 February 1894 -- 29 December 1986 -RRB- was a British Conservative politician and statesman who served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 10 January 1957 to 19 October 1963 . Nicknamed `` Supermac , '' he was known for his pragmatism , wit and unflappability .   Macmillan served in the Grenadier Guards during the First World War . He was wounded three times , most severely in September 1916 during the Battle of the Somme . He spent the rest of the war in a military hospital unable to walk , and suffered pain and partial immobility for the rest of his life . After the war Macmillan joined his family business , then entered Parliament in the 1924 General Election , for the northern industrial constituency of Stockton-on-Tees . After losing his seat in 1929 , he regained it in 1931 , soon after which he spoke out against the high rate of unemployment in Stockton-On-Tees , and against appeasement .   Rising to high office during the Second World War as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill , Macmillan then served as Foreign Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer under Churchill 's successor Sir Anthony Eden . When Eden resigned in 1957 after the Suez Crisis , Macmillan succeeded him as Prime Minister .   As a One Nation Tory of the Disraelian tradition , haunted by memories of the Great Depression , he believed in the post-war settlement and the necessity of a mixed economy , championing a Keynesian strategy of public investment to maintain demand and pursuing corporatist policies to develop the domestic market as the engine of growth . Benefiting from favourable international conditions , he presided over an age of affluence , marked by low unemployment and high if uneven growth . In his Bedford speech in July 1957 he told the nation they had ` never had it so good ' , but warned of the dangers of inflation , summing up the fragile prosperity of the 1950s . The Conservatives were re-elected in 1959 with an increased majority on an electioneering budget .   In international affairs , Macmillan rebuilt the special relationship with the United States from the wreckage of the Suez Crisis -LRB- of which he had been one of the architects -RRB- , and redrew the world map by decolonising sub-Saharan Africa . Reconfiguring the nation 's defences to meet the realities of the nuclear age , he ended National Service , strengthened the nuclear forces by acquiring Polaris , and pioneered the Nuclear Test Ban with the United States and the Soviet Union . Belatedly recognising the dangers of strategic dependence , he sought a new role for Britain in Europe , but his unwillingness to disclose United States nuclear secrets to France contributed to a French veto of the United Kingdom 's entry into the European Economic Community .   Near the end of his premiership , his government was rocked by the Vassall and Profumo scandals , which seemed to symbolise for the rebellious youth of the 1960s the moral decay of the British establishment . After his resignation , Macmillan lived out a long retirement as an elder statesman . He was as trenchant a critic of his successors in his old age as he had been of his predecessors in his youth .   Macmillan was the last British prime minister born in the reign of Queen Victoria , the last to have served in the First World War , the last to wear a moustache when in office , and the last to receive an hereditary peerage .

However , the last Rajah of Sarawak , Sir Charles Vyner Brooke decided to cede Sarawak as part of British Crown Colony in 1946 . Kuching remained as capital during the Crown Colony period . After the formation of Malaysia in 1963 , Kuching retained its status as state capital and was granted city status in 1988 . Since then , the Kuching city is divided into two administrative regions managed by two separate local authorities . The administrative centre of Sarawak state government is located at Wisma Bapa Malaysia , Kuching .   Kuching is a major food destination for tourists and the main gateway for travellers visiting Sarawak and Borneo .

Introduced in the show 's pilot as a naive runaway bride who reunites with her childhood best friend Monica and relocates to New York City , Rachel gradually evolves from a spoiled , inexperienced daddy 's girl into a successful businesswoman . During the show 's second season , the character becomes romantically involved with her friend Ross , with whom she maintains a complicated on-again , off-again relationship throughout the entire series .

The fifth-generation combat aircraft is designed to perform ground attack and air defense missions . It has three main models : the F-35A conventional takeoff and landing -LRB- CTOL -RRB- variant , the F-35B short take-off and vertical-landing -LRB- STOVL -RRB- variant , and the F-35C carrier-based Catapult Assisted Take-Off Barrier Arrested Recovery -LRB- CATOBAR -RRB- variant . On 31 July 2015 , the United States Marines declared ready for deployment the first squadron of F-35B fighters after intensive testing . On 2 August 2016 , the U.S. Air Force declared its first squadron of F-35A fighters combat-ready .   The F-35 descends from the X-35 , the winning design of the Joint Strike Fighter -LRB- JSF -RRB- program . An aerospace industry team led by Lockheed Martin designed and manufactures it . Other major F-35 industry partners include Northrop Grumman , Pratt & Whitney and BAE Systems . The F-35 first flew on 15 December 2006 . The United States plans to buy 2,663 aircraft . Its variants are to provide the bulk of the crewed tactical airpower of the U.S. Air Force , Navy and the Marine Corps over the coming decades . Deliveries of the F-35 for the U.S. military are scheduled until 2037 with a projected service life up to 2070 .   The United States principally funds the F-35 JSF development , with additional funding from partners . The partner nations are either NATO members or close U.S. allies .

In humans , other mammals , and birds , the heart is divided into four chambers : upper left and right atria ; and lower left and right ventricles .

The wall of the heart is made up of three layers : epicardium , myocardium , and endocardium .   The heart pumps blood with a rhythm determined by a group of pacemaking cells in the sinoatrial node .

{"claim": "John Deighton worked in California.", "wiki": "John Deighton -LRB- November 1830 -- May 23 , 1875 -RRB- , generally known as `` Gassy Jack '' , was a Canadian bar owner who was born in Hull , England . The Gastown neighbourhood of Vancouver , British Columbia is named after him .   Growing up in Hull , a major seaport , Deighton and his brothers Tom and Richard learned to sail . Tom and Richard apprenticed on British ships , but Jack did not receive that opportunity . However , this meant he could switch to sailing on U.S. ships . When the California Gold Rush hit , ships were in demand to transport cargo and people from New York to San Francisco . In 1850 , this voyage around Cape Horn took 140 -- 160 days . Deighton signed up to work a new clipper Invincible that could sail 400 miles a day and made the trip in only 115 days . The next journey was to Hong Kong . Deighton was 21 years old and Third Officer . Next , Deighton visited family at home in England and then returned to the U.S. , never returning to England again .   Next , Deighton worked a gold claim in California , along with many others , until February 1858 when there was news of gold further north in a British territory known as New Caledonia . The Fraser Canyon Gold Rush had begun and Deighton sailed north along with thousands of others . The harsh winter took its toll on the prospectors but Deighton stayed for 5 years . He found no gold , though others did . New Caledonia was now the Colony of British Columbia . Traffic on the Fraser River was increasing as more miners arrived , but so far only American steamers were able to travel beyond Langley . Local boats were built to meet this need and Deighton piloted steamships and sternwheelers on the Fraser River for several years .   By 1864 , Deighton was forced to pursue other lines of work as he developed health problems -LRB- swelling of the legs and feet -RRB- .   Between 1862 and 1867 , he ran a bar called the Globe Saloon in New Westminster , British Columbia . It was quite prosperous due to the Cariboo Gold Rush . But in 1867 when Deighton went out of town to visit the hot mineral springs near Harrison Lake , he entrusted the bar to an old shipmate , an American . On July 4 the celebrations got out of hand and Deighton returned to find his business ruined .   In 1867 , Deighton opened a bar on the south side of Burrard Inlet at the behest of his old friend , Captain Edward Stamp , the owner of the Hastings Mill . He later named it the Globe Saloon in memory of his previous bar in New Westminster . He came to the area with little more than $ 6 to his name , a few simple pieces of furniture , his native wife -LRB- whose name has been lost to the years -RRB- , and a yellow dog . The bar was built by idle sawmill workers in exchange for all the whiskey they could drink in one sitting -LRB- the nearest drinking hole was 25 miles away -RRB- . His patrons were mainly sailors and workers from the nearby sawmill . When business dwindled there , Deighton tried to acquire 20 waterfront acres near Moody 's Mill and build a new saloon there . The local natives protested and the Governor agreed - Deighton went back to his previous bar , the Globe Saloon . This bar was demolished when the townsite of Granville was established . Deighton bought a nearby lot for $ 135 at the south-west corner of Carrall and Water Streets , where he built Deighton House .   Deighton 's native wife died . Before she died she arranged for Deighton to marry her 12-year-old niece Quahail-ya , also known as Madeline or Matrine . In 1871 she gave birth to Richard Mason Deighton . Jack 's brother Tom Deighton and his wife took over the business in 1873 and Jack returned to working the steamship that plied the Fraser River , this time as a Captain of the steamer Onward . However , after a family quarrel a few months later , Jack resumed management of the saloon and operated it until he became ill and died at the age of 44 on May 23 , 1875 . He is interred at the Fraser Cemetery in New Westminster , British Columbia . The location of the monument is -LRB- WGS84 -RRB- .   Deighton was known as Gassy Jack because of his talkative nature and his penchant for storytelling . The name stuck and the area around his bar is now known as Gastown .   He was succeeded by his son with Quahail-ya , Richard , who was derisively nicknamed the `` Earl of Granville '' . Richard died before Jack 's meager estate -LRB- about $ 300 -RRB- was probated . Quahail-ya returned to the North Shore and married `` Big William '' . She outlived him too , and died August 10 , 1948 , aged 90 .

{"claim": "John Deighton developed swelling of the hands.", "wiki": "John Deighton -LRB- November 1830 -- May 23 , 1875 -RRB- , generally known as `` Gassy Jack '' , was a Canadian bar owner who was born in Hull , England . The Gastown neighbourhood of Vancouver , British Columbia is named after him .   Growing up in Hull , a major seaport , Deighton and his brothers Tom and Richard learned to sail . Tom and Richard apprenticed on British ships , but Jack did not receive that opportunity . However , this meant he could switch to sailing on U.S. ships . When the California Gold Rush hit , ships were in demand to transport cargo and people from New York to San Francisco . In 1850 , this voyage around Cape Horn took 140 -- 160 days . Deighton signed up to work a new clipper Invincible that could sail 400 miles a day and made the trip in only 115 days . The next journey was to Hong Kong . Deighton was 21 years old and Third Officer . Next , Deighton visited family at home in England and then returned to the U.S. , never returning to England again .   Next , Deighton worked a gold claim in California , along with many others , until February 1858 when there was news of gold further north in a British territory known as New Caledonia . The Fraser Canyon Gold Rush had begun and Deighton sailed north along with thousands of others . The harsh winter took its toll on the prospectors but Deighton stayed for 5 years . He found no gold , though others did . New Caledonia was now the Colony of British Columbia . Traffic on the Fraser River was increasing as more miners arrived , but so far only American steamers were able to travel beyond Langley . Local boats were built to meet this need and Deighton piloted steamships and sternwheelers on the Fraser River for several years .   By 1864 , Deighton was forced to pursue other lines of work as he developed health problems -LRB- swelling of the legs and feet -RRB- .   Between 1862 and 1867 , he ran a bar called the Globe Saloon in New Westminster , British Columbia . It was quite prosperous due to the Cariboo Gold Rush . But in 1867 when Deighton went out of town to visit the hot mineral springs near Harrison Lake , he entrusted the bar to an old shipmate , an American . On July 4 the celebrations got out of hand and Deighton returned to find his business ruined .   In 1867 , Deighton opened a bar on the south side of Burrard Inlet at the behest of his old friend , Captain Edward Stamp , the owner of the Hastings Mill . He later named it the Globe Saloon in memory of his previous bar in New Westminster . He came to the area with little more than $ 6 to his name , a few simple pieces of furniture , his native wife -LRB- whose name has been lost to the years -RRB- , and a yellow dog . The bar was built by idle sawmill workers in exchange for all the whiskey they could drink in one sitting -LRB- the nearest drinking hole was 25 miles away -RRB- . His patrons were mainly sailors and workers from the nearby sawmill . When business dwindled there , Deighton tried to acquire 20 waterfront acres near Moody 's Mill and build a new saloon there . The local natives protested and the Governor agreed - Deighton went back to his previous bar , the Globe Saloon . This bar was demolished when the townsite of Granville was established . Deighton bought a nearby lot for $ 135 at the south-west corner of Carrall and Water Streets , where he built Deighton House .   Deighton 's native wife died . Before she died she arranged for Deighton to marry her 12-year-old niece Quahail-ya , also known as Madeline or Matrine . In 1871 she gave birth to Richard Mason Deighton . Jack 's brother Tom Deighton and his wife took over the business in 1873 and Jack returned to working the steamship that plied the Fraser River , this time as a Captain of the steamer Onward . However , after a family quarrel a few months later , Jack resumed management of the saloon and operated it until he became ill and died at the age of 44 on May 23 , 1875 .

{"claim": "Off the Wall is a work.", "wiki": "Off the Wall is the fifth studio album by American singer Michael Jackson , released on August 10 , 1979 in the United States by Epic Records and internationally by CBS Records . It was his nineteenth album in total since Diana Ross Presents The Jackson 5 -LRB- 1969 -RRB- , as well as his first album released through Epic Records , the label he would record on until his death roughly 30 years later . It was released following Jackson 's critically well-received film performance in The Wiz . While working on that project , Jackson and Quincy Jones had become friends , and Jones agreed to work with Jackson on his next studio album . Recording sessions took place between December 1978 and June 1979 at Allen Zentz Recording , Westlake Recording Studios , and Cherokee Studios in Los Angeles , California . Jackson collaborated with a number of writers and performers , such as Paul McCartney , Stevie Wonder and Rod Temperton . Five singles were released from the album ; three of the singles had music videos released . Jackson wrote three of the songs himself , including the number-one Grammy Award-winning single `` Do n't Stop 'Til You Get Enough '' .   The record was a departure from Jackson 's previous work for Motown Records . Its lyrical themes on the record relate to escapism , liberation , loneliness , hedonism and romance . Several critics observed that Off the Wall was crafted from funk , disco , soft rock , jazz , Broadway and pop ballads . Jackson received positive reviews for his vocal performance on the record . The record gained critical acclaim and recognition , and won the singer his first Grammy Award . With Off the Wall , Jackson became the first solo artist to have four singles from the same album peak inside the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 . The album was an enormous commercial success ; as of 2014 it is certified eight times platinum in the United States and has reportedly sold more than 20 million copies worldwide , making it one of the best selling albums of all time . On October 16 , 2001 , a special edition reissue of Off the Wall was released by Sony Records . It was re-released on February 26 , 2016 . Recent reviews by AllMusic and Blender have continued to praise Off the Wall for its appeal in the 21st century . In 2003 , the album was placed at number 68 on Rolling Stone list of `` The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time '' .

The sequels were directed by Darren Lynn Bousman , David Hackl , and Kevin Greutert , and were written by Wan , Whannell , Bousman , Patrick Melton , and Marcus Dunstan , and were released subsequently every October , on the Friday before Halloween , between 2004 and 2010 . Both of the creators remained with the franchise as executive producers . On July 22 , 2010 , producer Mark Burg confirmed that the seventh film , Saw 3D , is the final installment of the series . Series creators James Wan and Leigh Whannell are still open to continuing the series , however , if they can do something `` different '' with the material . The films collectively grossed over $ 873 million at the box office worldwide . Lionsgate reportedly expressed interest in continuing the franchise in 2012 with a reboot . However , in November 2013 , it was reported that they were in active development of a sequel .   The franchise revolves around John Kramer , also called the `` Jigsaw Killer '' or simply `` Jigsaw '' . He was introduced briefly in Saw and developed in more detail in Saw II . Rather than killing his victims outright , Jigsaw traps them in situations that he calls `` tests '' or `` games '' to test their will to live through physical or psychological torture . Despite the fact that John was murdered in Saw III , the films continue to focus on the posthumous influence of the Jigsaw Killer and his apprentices by exploring his character via flashbacks .   The film series as a whole has received mostly mixed to negative reviews by critics , but has been a financial success at the box office and is one of the highest grossing horror film franchies of all time . While the films are often compared to the American horror film Hostel -LRB- 2005 -RRB- and classified as torture porn by critics , the creators of Saw disagree with the term `` torture porn '' . Writer Luke Y. Thompson of OC Weekly argued that , unlike Hostel , the Saw films actually have less torture than most in the sense of sadism or masochism , as Jigsaw believes that those who survive his methods will be stronger people for it . He called him a kind of a '' -LRB- deranged -RRB- philanthropist '' .

{"claim": "Touchscreens are used in electronic voting and gaming machines.", "wiki": "A touchscreen is an input and output device normally layered on the top of an electronic visual display of an information processing system . A user can give input or control the information processing system through simple or multi-touch gestures by touching the screen with a special stylus and/or one or more fingers . Some touchscreens use ordinary or specially coated gloves to work while others may only work using a special stylus/pen . The user can use the touchscreen to react to what is displayed and to control how it is displayed ; for example , zooming to increase the text size .   The touchscreen enables the user to interact directly with what is displayed , rather than using a mouse , touchpad , or any other such device -LRB- other than a stylus , which is optional for most modern touchscreens -RRB- .   Touchscreens are common in devices such as game consoles , personal computers , tablet computers , electronic voting machines , point of sale systems , and smartphones . They can also be attached to computers or , as terminals , to networks . They also play a prominent role in the design of digital appliances such as personal digital assistants -LRB- PDAs -RRB- and some e-readers .   The popularity of smartphones , tablets , and many types of information appliances is driving the demand and acceptance of common touchscreens for portable and functional electronics .

{"claim": "Rabies is a disease.", "wiki": "Rabies is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the brain in humans and other mammals . Early symptoms can include fever and tingling at the site of exposure . These symptoms are followed by one or more of the following symptoms : violent movements , uncontrolled excitement , fear of water , an inability to move parts of the body , confusion , and loss of consciousness . Once symptoms appear , the result is nearly always death . The time period between contracting the disease and the start of symptoms is usually one to three months ; however , this time period can vary from less than one week to more than one year . The time is dependent on the distance the virus must travel to reach the central nervous system .   Rabies is caused by lyssaviruses , including the rabies virus and Australian bat lyssavirus . Rabies is spread when an infected animal scratches or bites another animal or human . Saliva from an infected animal can also transmit rabies if the saliva comes into contact with the eyes , mouth , or nose . Globally , dogs are the most common animal involved . More than 99 % of rabies cases in countries where dogs commonly have the disease are caused by dog bites . In the Americas , bat bites are the most common source of rabies infections in humans , and less than 5 % of cases are from dogs . Rodents are very rarely infected with rabies . The rabies virus travels to the brain by following the peripheral nerves . The disease can only be diagnosed after the start of symptoms .   Animal control and vaccination programs have decreased the risk of rabies from dogs in a number of regions of the world .

In people who have been exposed to rabies , the rabies vaccine and sometimes rabies immunoglobulin are effective in preventing the disease if the person receives the treatment before the start of rabies symptoms . Washing bites and scratches for 15 minutes with soap and water , povidone iodine , or detergent may reduce the number of viral particles and may be somewhat effective at preventing transmission .

In 1898 he joined the esoteric Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn , where he was trained in ceremonial magic by Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers and Allan Bennett . Moving to Boleskine House by Loch Ness in Scotland , he went mountaineering in Mexico with Oscar Eckenstein , before studying Hindu and Buddhist practices in India .

He founded the religion of Thelema , identifying himself as the prophet entrusted with guiding humanity into the \u00c6on of Horus in the early 20th century . A prolific writer , he published widely over the course of his life .   Born to a wealthy Plymouth Brethren family in Royal Leamington Spa , Warwickshire , Crowley rejected this fundamentalist Christian faith to pursue an interest in Western esotericism . He was educated at the University of Cambridge , where he focused his attentions on mountaineering and poetry , resulting in several publications . Some biographers allege that here he was recruited into a British intelligence agency , further suggesting that he remained a spy throughout his life . In 1898 he joined the esoteric Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn , where he was trained in ceremonial magic by Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers and Allan Bennett . Moving to Boleskine House by Loch Ness in Scotland , he went mountaineering in Mexico with Oscar Eckenstein , before studying Hindu and Buddhist practices in India . He married Rose Edith Kelly and in 1904 they honeymooned in Cairo , Egypt , where Crowley claimed to have been contacted by a supernatural entity named Aiwass , who provided him with The Book of the Law , a sacred text that served as the basis for Thelema . Announcing the start of the \u00c6on of Horus , The Book declared that its followers should `` Do what thou wilt '' and seek to align themselves with their True Will through the practice of magick .   After an unsuccessful attempt to climb Kanchenjunga and a visit to India and China , Crowley returned to Britain , where he attracted attention as a prolific author of poetry , novels , and occult literature . In 1907 , he and George Cecil Jones co-founded a Thelemite order , the A \u2234 A \u2234 , through which they propagated the religion . After spending time in Algeria , in 1912 he was initiated into another esoteric order , the German-based Ordo Templi Orientis -LRB- O.T.O. -RRB- , rising to become the leader of its British branch , which he reformulated in accordance with his Thelemite beliefs . Through the O.T.O. , Thelemite groups were established in Britain , Australia , and North America . Crowley spent the First World War in the United States , where he took up painting and campaigned for the German war effort against Britain , later revealing that he had infiltrated the pro-German movement to assist the British intelligence services . In 1920 he established the Abbey of Thelema , a religious commune in Cefal\u00f9 , Sicily where he lived with various followers . His libertine lifestyle led to denunciations in the British press , and the Italian government evicted him in 1923 . He divided the following two decades between France , Germany , and England , and continued to promote Thelema until his death .   Crowley gained widespread notoriety during his lifetime , being a recreational drug experimenter , bisexual and an individualist social critic . He was denounced in the popular press as `` the wickedest man in the world '' and a Satanist .
